	* oml2-apps: Renamed all application binaries to start with
	'oml2-', based on email discussions with Max & Christoph.  Added
	install-exec-hook targets to all Makefile.am's to install symlinks
	from the old names to the new binaries to avoid breaking existing
	scripts.

	* oml2-apps: All apps are now separately buildable with their own
	Autotools build system.  They can be built in one fell swoop using
	as well from the top level (implemented with Autoconf submodules,
	i.e. AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS.

	* oml2-apps: Converted all the apps so that they no longer use
	OML_LONG_VALUE, which is deprecated in OML 2.4.  Also make use of
	wider integer types and unsigned integer types like
	OML_UINT64_VALUE where appropriate.

	* oml2-apps: Cleaned up the build system to do better library
	autodetection and header inclusion.

	* oml2-apps: Various bug fixes and cleanups across all apps, but
	particularly in trace_oml2.

	* iperf/src/main.cpp (main): Changed the names of measurement
	points "TCP_received" and "UDP_received" to "TCP_Info" and
	"UDP_Rich_Info", respectively, when run as a server.  When run as
	the client, iperf now offers MP's "UDP_Rich_Info" (same as server)
	and "UDP_Periodic_Info".

	* otg/port/udp_inport.cpp (UDPInPort): In the "udp_in" measurement
	point, changed the names of "dst_host" and "dst_port" to
	"src_host" and "src_port", respectively.

	* trace_oml2: Extended to support measurement of TCP and UDP
	traffic properties.

	* gps_oml2: Replaced the gps_oml2 program with a version that uses
	gpsd instead of reading directly from the GPS device file.

	* oml2-apps: Fix bugs in wlanconfig_oml2.

2010-03-17    <jolyon.white@nicta.com.au>

	* oml2-apps: Initial release of OML Applications from their own
	source repository (separate from core OML).

	* configure.ac: Add checks for library headers; don't generate the
	build system if there are missing headers.
