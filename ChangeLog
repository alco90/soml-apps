	* oml2-app: re-canonalised all names to APPNAME-oml2 symlinks
	omf_APPNAME, APPNAME_oml2 and oml2-APPNAME are still provided
	for convenience, but will be removed in the future (2.9.0).
	* otg2: name `otg' without number is now deprecated; symlink
	name otg2 and otr2 will remain in the future for ease of use,
	though the canonical names are ot{g,r}2-oml2.
	* gpslogger: support for gpsd API version 5
	* ripwave-monitor: app renamed to ripwavemon (binary:
	ripwavemon-oml2)
	* simple: removed simple generator; see the example/ directory
	of oml-2.7.0's source tree (or PREFIX/usr/share/oml2) for an
	up-to-date version.
	* iperf: removed elderly 1.7 fork from this distribution; see instead
	the standalone iperf-oml2, also maintained at mytestbed.net

	* omf_nmetrics/omf_nmetrics.c (main):
	* omf_trace/omf_trace.c (main):
	* gps/gps.c (main):
	* wlanconfig/wlanconfig_oml.c (main): Fix omlc_init() call in
	omf_trace, omf_nmetrics, gps, and wlanconfig to use a modified
	appname with all hyphens changed to underscores.  liboml2 rejects
	names with hyphens in them.

2010-10-13  Jolyon White  <jolyon.white@nicta.com.au>

	* otg/lib/app/application.cpp (Application): Change OML
	application name string handling to change hyphens '-' to
	underscores '_' to keep the OML library happy.  OML names must be
	like C identifiers.

	* ripwave_monitor/ripwave-monitor.c: Add application to monitor
	the status output from a Ripwave pre-WiMAX modem (author Olivier
	Mehani).

	* oml2-apps: Renamed all application binaries to start with
	'oml2-', based on email discussions with Max & Christoph.  Added
	install-exec-hook targets to all Makefile.am's to install symlinks
	from the old names to the new binaries to avoid breaking existing
	scripts.

	* oml2-apps: All apps are now separately buildable with their own
	Autotools build system.  They can be built in one fell swoop using
	as well from the top level (implemented with Autoconf submodules,
	i.e. AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS.

	* oml2-apps: Converted all the apps so that they no longer use
	OML_LONG_VALUE, which is deprecated in OML 2.4.  Also make use of
	wider integer types and unsigned integer types like
	OML_UINT64_VALUE where appropriate.

	* oml2-apps: Cleaned up the build system to do better library
	autodetection and header inclusion.

	* oml2-apps: Various bug fixes and cleanups across all apps, but
	particularly in trace_oml2.

	* iperf/src/main.cpp (main): Changed the names of measurement
	points "TCP_received" and "UDP_received" to "TCP_Info" and
	"UDP_Rich_Info", respectively, when run as a server.  When run as
	the client, iperf now offers MP's "UDP_Rich_Info" (same as server)
	and "UDP_Periodic_Info".

	* otg/port/udp_inport.cpp (UDPInPort): In the "udp_in" measurement
	point, changed the names of "dst_host" and "dst_port" to
	"src_host" and "src_port", respectively.

	* trace_oml2: Extended to support measurement of TCP and UDP
	traffic properties.

	* gps_oml2: Replaced the gps_oml2 program with a version that uses
	gpsd instead of reading directly from the GPS device file.

2010-04-12    <jolyon.white@nicta.com.au>

	* oml2-apps: Fix bugs in wlanconfig_oml2.

2010-03-17    <jolyon.white@nicta.com.au>

	* oml2-apps: Initial release of OML Applications from their own
	source repository (separate from core OML).

	* configure.ac: Add checks for library headers; don't generate the
	build system if there are missing headers.
